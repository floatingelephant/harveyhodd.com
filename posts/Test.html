<p>There is a lot of talk around high energy prices in the UK and what that means for us, but with very little analysis as to why they are high and what we can do about it. This post should help define the latter parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, energy markets follow supply and demand. If we don’t produce any energy and supply is low, demand causes prices to rise. Secondly, energy demand is very inelastic. Price elasticity is defined by the percentage change in quantity consumed divided by the percentage change in price. Energy demand in the short-term is very inelastic (e.g demand doesn’t change much with increasing costs), as people still need to heat their homes, cook, or travel to work. This is why we see large price spikes, as if demand is inelastic, the new equilibrium requires a much higher price to reduce demand in the long-term. Until it reaches that new equilibrium, prices stay high in a local maxima, until the price-point becomes prohibitively expensive for even the daily essentials, which drops demand and pulls price with it.</p>
<p>What is the state of play today?<br>

</a></p>
<p><img src="posts/resources/image.png"></p>

<p>The UK consumed 1710 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy in 2023, across the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport: The largest consumer, accounting for about 38% of total energy consumption.</li>
<li>Domestic (Households):** Approximately 29%.</li>
<li>Industry:** Around 17%.</li>
<li>Services:** Roughly 13%.</li>
<li>Agriculture and Other Sectors:** The remaining percentage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within that, the energy itself was made-up of:</p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas</strong>: Approximately 705 TWh</p>
<p><strong>Oil</strong>: Approximately 603 TWh <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67e4f62cf356a2dc0e39b522/Energy_Trends_March_2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK</a></p>
<p><strong>Coal</strong>: Approximately 51 TWh <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89nergie_au_Royaume-Uni?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Wikipédia, l’encyclopédie libre+1GOV.UK+1</a></p>
<p><strong>Nuclear</strong>: Approximately 124 TWh <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89nergie_au_Royaume-Uni?utm_source=chatgpt.com">GOV.UK+2Wikipédia, l’encyclopédie libre+2GOV.UK+2</a></p>
<p><strong>Renewables</strong>: Approximately 261 TWh</p>
<p>Now, where does that energy come from?</p>
<p>Natural gas (42% imported)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Norway</strong>: ~41% of total UK gas imports</li>
<li><strong>United States</strong>: Significant supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG)</li>
<li><strong>Qatar</strong>: Notable LNG exporter to the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>~43.6% of total energy imports</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Crude Oil</strong>: Primarily from Norway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined Products</strong>: Notably from the Netherlands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The UK imports both crude oil for domestic refining and refined petroleum products to meet demand</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Coal</p>
<p><strong>Import Share</strong>: ~2.7% of total energy imports<br>
<strong>Key Sources</strong>: Various international suppliers<br>
<strong>Notes</strong>: Coal imports have decreased significantly, especially with the closure of the UK’s last coal-fired power plant in 2024</p>
<p>Bio energy<br>
<strong>Import Share</strong>: ~1.6% of total energy imports<br>
<strong>Key Sources</strong>: Various international suppliers<br>
<strong>Notes</strong>: The UK imports biomass materials, such as wood pellets, to support its renewable energy initiatives.</p>
<p>Electricity<br>
<strong>Import Share</strong>: ~1.4% of total energy imports<br>
<strong>Key Sources</strong>: Interconnectors with France, the Netherlands, and Belgium<br>
<strong>Notes</strong>: Electricity imports help balance the grid, especially during periods of low domestic renewable generation</p>
<p>If we look exclusively at electricity, why is it so expensive? It’s currently made up of roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Gas</strong>: 34%</li>
<li><strong>Wind</strong>: 29.4%</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear</strong>: 14.2%</li>
<li><strong>Solar</strong>: 4.7%</li>
<li><strong>Hydroelectric</strong>: 1.9%</li>
<li><strong>Biomass and Waste</strong>: 11.7%</li>
<li><strong>Coal</strong>: 1%</li>
<li><strong>Electricity Imports</strong>: 10.7% <a href="https://www.neso.energy/news/britains-electricity-explained-2023-review?utm_source=chatgpt.com">National Energy System Operator (NESO)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Natural Gas accounts for ~34% of the UK’s electricity generation, with only ~56% being produced domestically in the North Sea, with the balance being made up from Norway and LNG imports across the UK, Middle-east and Asia.</p>
<p>The pricing of this gas follows supply and demand laws, specifically global supply and domestic storage. The UK has very little gas storage, made worse after closing it’s largest storage facility (Rough) in 2017. As of today, there is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6d4c632f-39e1-4c93-8f1c-ba2b7a79752d">3.1 billion m^3</a> (30-35 TWh) of storage, meaning we have between 12 days (average winter demand) and 7.5 days (peak winter demand) of storage. This is in contrast to countries like Germany, Netherlands and France, that have &gt;100 days worth of storage.</p>
<p>As storage dwindles and natural gas maintains a large % of overall energy, the UK becomes over-exposed to market fluctuations. Most-recently, the combination of harsh weather and low-storage reserves in January 2025 caused emergency purchasing of LNG from Asia, Egypt and the Middle-east.</p>
<p>Since the UK operates on a liberalised energy market (where energy is bought and sold in a free-market rather than a state-controlled mechanism), it causes the floor pricing to reflect that of the most expensive producer required to meet demand. What that really means, is that when the most expensive gas is fired in the most expensive, inefficient gas-peaker plant, this sets the market pricing for the entire market, meaning premium trickles down to everyone, irrelevant of whether they directly benefited from it. A good example of this inefficiency, is that when there’s oversupply of renewables during the middle of the day that should plummet pricing, it could be supported by the price-floor of a horrendously expensive producer.</p>
<p>One of the negative sides of this is that when energy suppliers sign contracts with customers, they lock themselves into pricing that doesn’t always reflect the volatility in the market. For example, Bulb, Avro Energy and Green Supplier limited all collapsed under the market spikes of 2021, impacting &gt;2.5m customers until the Government stepped in.</p>
<p>Transmission costs<br>
Another factor that drives pricing higher, is that the UK has some of the highest transmission fees in Europe. Largely this is a factor of both aging infrastructure (both electrical and gas) and grid-balancing to integrate renewables into the grid. {elaborate here}</p>
<p>Alongside electrical transmission, gas transmission (LNG imports via Isle of Grain, South Hook or Teeside) incur costs approx 70% higher than the average northwest European terminals. This costs are broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry capacity charges<br>
Injecting in the NTS (National Transmission system)</li>
<li>Exity capacity charges<br>
Delivering gas to customers</li>
<li>Commodity charges<br>
Volumetric fee per therm/kWh of gas transported</li>
</ul>
<p>This disincentivises gas shippers to ship into the UK, and instead divert cargoes away towards Belgium or Netherlands where entry fee’s are significantly lower.</p>
<p>Carbon costs</p>
<p>One of the more positive impacts that has caused prices to rise, is that since 2005, the ETS (UK emissions trading scheme) imposes a carbon tax on natural gas to price in environmental impact.</p>
<p>Whilst permitting speed to increase overall share of renewables and batteries to address the reliance on gas for electricity production, and carbon transmission costs have an impact on the overall energy cost in the UK, they are dwarfed by the impact of being a net-importer of energy with dwindling natural resources and next to no domestic storage.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>The North Sea Oil &amp; Gas field was discovered in the 1967, bringing with it almost 2 decades of net-exporter revenue, phasing out coal for cheaper, better gas, and reducing costs in-line with supply.</p>
<p>However, by 2000 the production of both gas and oil had peaked, with no new major field discoveries. Very quickly the UK shifted back to being a net-importer by 2004, whilst severely underinvesting in energy storage, grid expansion, and renewable integration.</p>
<p>Despite large offshore wind build-out, and the learning rate of renewables delivering more commercial viability, scale and deployment, gas still dominated base-load generation, and in-turn put the UK at the mercy of the global spot-price throughout the 2010’s.</p>
<p>Whilst this wasn’t crushing in all scenarios during that time, the UK energy production was propped up on weak stilts waiting for a flash-point or black swan event to bring it to it’s knee’s. This was then delivered by COVID in 2021, where initially energy prices plummeted as a result of the global supply chain halting. However, as industry roared back to action a few months later, the UK was caught short on supply and suffered large price spikes throughout the summer of X date. The double-whammy was then delivered by the Ukraine war, showing the UK’s over reliance on Russian gas imports once they were cut-off. A record price of X was reached.</p>
<p>When distilled, high energy prices act like a regressive tax on society, with wide-ranging negative effects like increased poverty and inequality, industrial ineffectiveness, higher inflation and trade deficits, and political stress.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that heavy industry with large power demands such as steel, chemicals and cement are largely produced overseas when energy costs are both &gt;X% of total production costs, but also when they are 6-8x higher than other markets.</p>
<p>(Insert image on costs)</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>The current zeitgeist surrounding the re-industrialisation the UK should be reviewed with the lens of why it left our shores in the first-place. Unless we find ways to dramatically increase gross-domestic energy production and increase national storage, it’s highly unlikely (or impossible without subsidies) for any sort of significant industrial process can be economical in the UK. Alongside this, there is likely to be exasperation of the UK’s over exposure to importing energy as we likely enter a demand-boom in the form of Ai data centres.</p>
<p>Despite this, there are a number of key elements that can help stem the bleed and drive towards a more sustainable and affordable energy market in the UK.</p>
<ul>
<li>Massively ramp-up battery connections</li>
</ul>
<p>The common misconception is that the only way to integate renewables effectively into the grid is to build out the transmission to allow greater energy distribution. <em>This misses the point and requires us to build more transmission this year than we have over the last 20 years.</em> Instead, we need to benefit from the learning rate of batteries and build huge amount of storage, to buffer production timings and smooth out the grid. Reference the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build large storage supplies with long-term LNG contracts<br>
Reduce exposure to the spot-market with better planning and storage inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Innovate on production technology to deliver energy independence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The work we’re doing at Rivan Industries is designed specifically for this. We produce synthetic fuel plants with only solar and water as inputs, producing synthetic Natural Gas competitively with fossil-alternatives.</p>
<p>Alongside these direct measures, there is likely a number of tariffs and subsidies that would incentivise new carbon-neutral producers, new industrial consumers, and new distributors that accelerate the race back to manufacturing in the UK.</p>
