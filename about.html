<p>Currently building a synthetic fuel company, Rivan, to try and provide the UK with a reliable source of decarbonised energy. I wrote this manifesto on exactly how I intend on doing it. TLDR the plan is: 

 - Most things will be electrified that don't either have an energy density requirement (e.g long-haul aviation) or a molecular requirement (e.g chemicals, plastics, paints etc etc). For those 2 areas, you can't add a battery and they are currently very carbon intensive (steel, cement, chemical, aviation) with very little alternative. 12GT/year. 
 - To capture gigatonnes of carbon from those industries you need to create a valuable end product from the captured carbon (e.g Synthetic hydrocarbons), as carbon credits don't scale in the limit nor benefit from capitalist driven learning-rates 
 - To produce those hydrocarbons cheaper than drilling them from the ground it's purely a thermodynamic challenge, which means its an energy cost challenge. To do so, you need to (1) use the cheapest energy on-earth (solar), and (2) vertically integrate all manufacturing to use *more* of that energy to benefit from the learning-rate of solar
 - Once generated, you can back-distribute those fuels (starting with synthetic Natural Gas) into the gas-grid all over Europe as a drop-in replacement for traditional heavy machinery and processes.  
 - Each day, you can drive down the marginal cost of production until at some point it's more profitable to mine the sky vs drill the ground and the net-excess of CO2 in the air is halted and the world can survive 

Previously build 2 software companies to exit, using the proceeds to fund the first steps of Rivan. Interesting in learning new things, building company cultures, the Innovators Dilemma, and behaviour science.
