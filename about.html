  Currently building a synthetic fuel company, <strong>Rivan</strong>, to provide the UK with a reliable source of decarbonised energy.
  I wrote <a href="https://your-manifesto-link.example">this manifesto</a> on exactly how I intend on doing it.
  <abbr title="Too Long; Didn’t Read">TLDR</abbr> — the plan is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Most things will be electrified that don’t either have an energy-density requirement
    (e.g.&nbsp;long-haul aviation) or a molecular requirement (e.g.&nbsp;chemicals, plastics, paints).
    Those two areas can’t add a battery and are currently very carbon-intensive
    (steel, cement, chemical, aviation) with very little alternative&nbsp;— about 12 Gt CO₂ per year.
  </li>

  <li>
    To capture gigatonnes of carbon from those industries you need to create a valuable end-product
    from the captured carbon (e.g.&nbsp;synthetic hydrocarbons), because carbon credits don’t scale
    in the limit nor benefit from capitalist-driven learning rates.
  </li>

  <li>
    Producing those hydrocarbons cheaper than drilling them from the ground is purely a thermodynamic
    challenge — which means an <em>energy-cost</em> challenge. To do so you must<br>
    (1)&nbsp;use the cheapest energy on earth (solar), and<br>
    (2)&nbsp;vertically integrate all manufacturing to use <em>more</em> of that energy and capture
    the learning-rate of solar.
  </li>

  <li>
    Once generated, you can back-distribute those fuels (starting with synthetic natural gas)
    into the gas grid all over Europe as a drop-in replacement for traditional heavy machinery
    and processes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Each day, you can drive down the marginal cost of production until, at some point,
    it’s more profitable to mine the sky than drill the ground; the net excess of atmospheric CO₂
    is halted and the world can survive.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Previously built two software companies to exit, using the proceeds to fund the first steps of Rivan.
  Interested in learning new things, off-grid living, building company cultures, the Innovator’s Dilemma,
  and behavioural science.
