<p>There's so much talk about energy prices in the UK being high, but where are the facts that back this up? Why are they high? What does high mean in relation to other countries? When did this start? When is it going to stop? What can we do about it? Let's try and asnwer those questions.</p>
<p>Firstly, energy markets follow supply and demand. If we don’t produce any energy and supply is low, demand causes prices to rise. Secondly, energy demand is very inelastic. Price elasticity is defined by the percentage change in quantity consumed divided by the percentage change in price. Energy demand in the short-term is very inelastic (e.g demand doesn’t change much with increasing costs), as people still need to heat their homes, cook, or travel to work. This is why we see large price spikes, as if demand is inelastic, the new equilibrium requires a much higher price to reduce demand in the long-term. Until it reaches that new equilibrium, prices stay high in a local maxima, until the price-point becomes prohibitively expensive for even the daily essentials, which drops demand and pulls price with it.</p>
<p>What is the state of play today?</p>
